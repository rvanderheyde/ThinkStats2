All the News in 2012
=========

In this report, I explored the Pew Research Center's News Coverage Index dataset. It contains data on stories published by different news sources over the period from January to May 2012. The stories in the dataset number 20,447 of which 1,977 are from newspapers, 3242 from online, 5,186 from network television, 6,472 from cable news, and 3,570 from radio programs. Variables encoded included story date, ID, prominance, duration or word count, source, format, and topic. Duration or word count seem to me like good proxies for what the media cares about (and maybe what the public cares about), as a newspaper or cable news station will spend more ink or time respectively on a more important story to them than a less important one. From this we must ask, can we predict how a story will be covered in terms of duration and word count?
