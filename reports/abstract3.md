## All the News in 2010 and 2012

Radmer van der Heyde

I examined the Pew News Coverage Index dataset from the years 2010 and 2012 to see how the different topics and stories were covered across media sectors and sources. The combined dataset had over 70,000 stories from all media sectors: print, online, cable tv, network tv, and broadcast radio. From the data, topics have less variance in word count and duration than sources. [Report](https://github.com/rvanderheyde/ThinkStats2/blob/master/reports/report3.md)
