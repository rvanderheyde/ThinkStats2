Are Diseases of the Heart Periodic?
======================================

There are many diseases that are known to be periodic. Influenza and Pnuemonia, for example, see an increase in incidence during the winter months, which is why this season is known as "Cold and Flu season." This increase in incidence also leads to an increase in deaths due to Influenza and Pnuemonia, which can be seen in the figures below.

But is heart disease periodic? To answer that, I examined the [CDC Wonder](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html) database on the underlying cause of death for the state of California organized by month. It turns out there are 23 groupings of heart disease that are stored in the database. These are:

* 'Major cardiovascular diseases (I00-I78)'
* '#Diseases of heart (I00-I09,I11,I13,I20-I51)'
* 'Acute rheumatic fever and chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I00-I09)'
* 'Hypertensive heart disease (I11)'
* 'Hypertensive heart and renal disease (I13)'
* 'Ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25)')
* 'Acute myocardial infarction (I21-I22)'
* 'Other acute ischemic heart diseases (I24)'
* 'Other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease (I20,I25)'
* 'Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, so described (I25.0)'
* 'All other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease (I20,I25.1-I25.9)'
* 'Other heart diseases (I26-I51)'
* 'Acute and subacute endocarditis (I33)'
* 'Diseases of pericardium and acute myocarditis (I30-I31,I40)'
* 'Heart failure (I50)'
* 'All other forms of heart disease (I26-I28,I34-I38,I42-I49,I51)'
* '#Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease (I10,I12,I15)'
* '#Cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69)'
* '#Atherosclerosis (I70)'
* 'Other diseases of circulatory system (I71-I78)'
* '#Aortic aneurysm and dissection (I71)'
* 'Other diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries (I72-I78)'
* 'Other disorders of circulatory system (I80-I99)'

Note that a number of these contain multiple diseases ('Major Cardiovascular Diseases' for example); however this shouldn't have a major effect on the conclusions drawn. The full method is recorded in this [notebook](https://github.com/rvanderheyde/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/report1.ipynb)
