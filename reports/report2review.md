Overall I think the presentation of the work is well done. The figures and tables are readable, and the tone of the writing is appropriate. However, here is a list of changes I think that can be made:
* Explain the figures more. Even though it is obvious if someone were to look at it for a while point out how the difference is shown in the chart, and what that means.
* I don't understand the reasoning behind the tables. Why did you choose to divide income in that way? 
* Consider removing one of the 2 figures. PDF and a histogram present pretty similar information. 
* consider adding more thought into why this effect exists. There is not a whole lot of work done here on the why. You do a good job of showing that there is an effect from being in the military on Income, but do not go further.
