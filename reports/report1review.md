1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?
Do the rich care about their wealth more, and how does income effect the view on equality, creativity, security, and experiences.

2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?
European Social Survey 2014. 

3) What analyses did the author perform?
The author computed the cdfs of the high, medium, and low income level groups' responses to the survey question of how much they care about wealth on a 6 point scale. The author also jittered the data to smooth the cdf, which for a qualitative survey, I don't know if that is best practice. 

4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?
Debatable. The effect is small to medium at best, and seems could be explained by other factors.

5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?
Yes. The author strikes a good balance between formality and engagement. 

6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?
Formating is also pretty professional.
